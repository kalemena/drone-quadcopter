== Configuring Betaflight

* GPS BN-880 - enable Galileo

```bash
set gps_ublox_use_galileo = on
```


* Magnetometer (Compass) CLI settings:

```bash
# set align_mag = CW270FLIP
align_mag set to CW270FLIP
# set mag_hardware = auto
mag_hardware set to AUTO
```

NOTE: Compass can be verified when plug to PC by rotating the GPS should move slightly the Quad display like moving controller itself.
