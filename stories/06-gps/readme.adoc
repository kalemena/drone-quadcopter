Here are references to wiring a GPS to Matek f405 CTR and configuring in Betaflight.

== Configuring Betaflight

* GPS BN-880 - enable Galileo

```bash
set gps_ublox_use_galileo = on
```


* Magnetometer (Compass) CLI settings:

```bash
# set align_mag = CW270FLIP
align_mag set to CW270FLIP
# set mag_hardware = auto
mag_hardware set to AUTO
```

NOTE: Compass can be verified when plug to PC by rotating the GPS should move slightly the Quad display like moving controller itself.

Tips on values for compass:

0 		driver default
 1 	CW0_DEG 	 not rotated or flipped
 2 	 CW90_DEG 	 rotated by 90 degrees (Z axis), not flipped (X axis)
 3 	CW180_DEG 	 rotated by 180 degrees (Z axis), not flipped (X axis)
 4 	 CW270_DEG 	 rotated by 270 degrees (Z axis), not flipped (X axis)
 5 	 CW0_DEG_FLIP 	 rotated by 0 degrees (Z axis), flipped (X axis)
 6 	 CW90_DEG_FLIP 	rotated by 90 degrees (Z axis), flipped (X axis)
 7 	CW180_DEG_FLIP 	 rotated by 180 degrees (Z axis), flipped (X axis)
 8 	CW270_DEG_FLIP 	 rotated by 270 degrees (Z axis), flipped (X axis)
