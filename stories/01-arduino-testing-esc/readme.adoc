= Arduino testing

Arduino can be used to test ESC directly.

== Tests

Sketches in this folder allow to test rotating ESC.

There are few things to understand, described inline in the sketches.

== ESC Specs

```bash
Specification: (Manual)
Brand Name: Racerstar
Item Name:New Beheli_S 30A ESC
Model: RS30A V2
Input Voltage: 2-4S
Con.Current:30A
Peak Current(10s):35A
BEC:NO
Programming :YES
Net Weight: 6.26g
Size:28*13mm


Features:
- Chips on EFM8BB21F16, 48MHZ Greatest .
- BLHeli_S is designed for superior performance in multirotors, and uses hardware generated motor pwm for smooth throttle response and silent operation.
- Small size combined with light weight for easy installation. 
- The code supports regular 1-2ms pulse width input, as well as Oneshot125 (125-250us), Oneshot42 (41.7-83.3us) and Multishot (5-25us).
- The input signal is automatically detected by the ESC upon power up.
- All codes use damped light mode.Damped light does regenerative braking, causing very fast motor retardation, and inherently also does active freewheeling
- The code supports features to prevent sync loss. There are tuneable parameters that can make the code run well even in the most demanding situations, although default settings will work
- excellently in normal operating environments
- The code also supports a beacon functionality, where the ESC will start beeping after a given time of zero throttle. This can be very useful for finding lost crafts.
